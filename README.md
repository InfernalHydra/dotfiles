This repository contains my various configuration files for both Mac OS and Linux (Ubuntu and Arch).  Additionally, there are installation scripts, but these are not finished/out of date for Linux.  **Use installation scripts at own risk.**

## Install
Run the following command
```
bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/infernalhydra/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```
